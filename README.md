# Roadmap  /WIP/
As we promised in the [whitepaper](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/Whitepaper), the **SpaceXpanse Multiverse** platform development will be carefully structured and will gradually broaden the scope of its tasks in a span of four years to avoid any roadblocks on its path. To acheve that we'll use two key parts of project management together - *milestones and iterations*. Milestones and iterations are two critical components of project's roadmap that play significant roles in managing a project successfully. **Milestones** are the significant checkpoints in a project plan that help track the progress and provide a framework to achieve the project goals. On the other hand, **iterations** are the incremental steps that a project team takes to achieve the milestones. Each iteration represents a set of tasks or features that are added to the product until the final product is complete.  All of them can be seen in [roadmap's tasks](https://github.com/orgs/SpaceXpanse/projects/28).

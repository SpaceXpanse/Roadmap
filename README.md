# Roadmap  /WIP/
As we promised in the whitepaper, the **SpaceXpanse Multiverse** projects' development will be carefully structured and will gradually broaden the scope of its tasks in a span of four years to avoid any roadblocks on its path. To acheve that we'll use two key parts of project management together - milestones and iterations. Milestones are significant events or goals that mark progress in a project, while iterations are smaller, more frequent stages of development that build towards the final product. Milestones are often used to indicate major accomplishments, while iterations focus on continuous improvement and refinement. In the roadmap, milestones will represent major releases or key project objectives, while iterations will outline specific tasks or phases of development. The former are allocated in [Roadmap Milestones](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/Roadmap/milestones), while the latter are allocated in [Roadmap's tasks](https://github.com/orgs/SpaceXpanse/projects/28).

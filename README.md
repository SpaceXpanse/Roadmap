# Roadmap objectives /WIP/
As we promised in the [whitepaper](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/Whitepaper), the **SpaceXpanse Multiverse** platform development will be carefully structured and will gradually broaden the scope of its tasks in a span of four years to avoid any roadblocks on its path. To achieve this we'll use two key parts of project management together - *milestones and iterations*. The milestones and iterations are two critical components of project's roadmap that play significant roles in managing the development process successfully. **Milestones** are the checkpoints in the project's plan that help track the progress and provide a framework to achieve the project's goals. On the other hand, **iterations** are the incremental steps that the project's team takes to achieve the milestones. Each iteration represents a set of tasks or features that are added to the project until the final goal is achieved.  All of them and how they fit together can be seen at [roadmap's tasks](https://github.com/orgs/SpaceXpanse/projects/28).

To make the development more quick and effective we'll develop the **SpaceXpanse Multiverse** platform and **SpaceXpanse: Wanderers** game together. The open-source nature of the former and the closed-source nature of the latter will enable these two projects to support and push each other further, so it's essential to establish clear communication between the teams and ensure compatibility between the projects. This will be achieved by using the full potential of all Github features - Teams, Projects, Actions, etc. And by sharing code and leveraging the projects' strengths, these two can accompany each other to accelerate development and improve the quality of the end product. The outcome will be a more effective and efficient development process that delivers better results.

## The milestones
Developing these two projects with a growing team can be challenging, but it is achievable by breaking the process down into three stages. Here is an overview of how to develop these projects on three stages, gradually broadening the number of people involved.  

**Stage 1: Starting small**  
The first stage of the development process involves starting small with a small team of dedicated developers. This team should be responsible for setting project goals, establishing coding standards, and building a foundation for the project. The team should be skilled in the necessary technologies and should have a clear understanding of the project's requirements. At this stage, communication between the team members should be open and frequent.

**Stage 2: Scaling up**  
Once the project's foundation is established, the second stage involves scaling up the development process by involving more people in the project. This may involve opening up the project to other developers who are interested in contributing, such as by creating a public repository on a platform like GitHub. At this stage, it's important to ensure that there are clear guidelines for contributing, such as coding standards, code review processes, and documentation requirements.

**Stage 3: Going big**  
In the third and final stage, the project should be opened up to a wider community of developers and users. This can be achieved by promoting the project on social media, reaching out to relevant communities, and hosting events or hackathons. At this stage, it's important to ensure that the project has a clear purpose and value proposition, and that contributors and users are engaged and motivated to participate in the development process.

Overall, developing open-source projects on three stages involves starting small with a dedicated team, scaling up the development process by involving more people, and going big by opening up the project to a wider community. 

## The iterations
Developing these two projects can be an effective way to ensure that the project continues to evolve and improve over time on quarterly iterations for a four-year period. Here is an overview of how to develop an open-source project on quarterly iterations for a four-year period.

**Year 1: Establish the project's vision and goals**
During the first year, it's important to establish the project's vision and goals. This involves defining the project's purpose, identifying its target audience, and establishing a roadmap of features and milestones. By the end of the first year, the project should have a clear direction and a roadmap that outlines the key goals for the next three years.

**Years 2-4: Execute quarterly iterations**
During years two to four, the project should focus on executing quarterly iterations. Each iteration should have a specific set of goals that are aligned with the project's overall roadmap. The goals for each iteration should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). It's important to regularly review the progress of each iteration and adjust the project roadmap as necessary.

At the end of each quarter, the project team should review the progress made during the iteration and assess the success of the goals. This should involve gathering feedback from users and developers, as well as analyzing data on the projects' performance. Based on this feedback, the team should prioritize the features and improvements that are needed for the next iteration.

Throughout the four-year period, the project team should prioritize regular code reviews, testing, and documentation to ensure that the project remains stable, secure, and easy to use. Additionally, the team should engage with the projects' community, such as by hosting events, contributing to relevant forums, and creating user-friendly documentation.

Overall, developing an open-source project on quarterly iterations for a four-year period requires careful planning, execution, and regular review. By following this approach, it's possible to ensure that the project evolves in line with user needs and remains relevant over time.
